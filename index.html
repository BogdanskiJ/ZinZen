                <b>Hi there!</b><br />
                <br />
                <b>ZinZen lets you plan your drive - so you can enjoy your life. A purpose planner.</b><br /> Create your best authentic self - with others. And keep your data private by default.<br /> From a bird's eye perspective: ZinZen is a platform
                for holistic self-direction and self-organization by collaborating individuals, teams and institutions. <br />
                <br />
                <b>How does ZinZen work?</b><br />
                <b>1.</b> Create goals for yourself, just like with any other todo-app. Swipe/right-click to edit. Tap/click for sub-goals.<br />
                <b>2.</b> ZinZen then: <br /> - <i>Helps</i> turn big life goals into simple tasks and habits.<br /> - <i>Plans</i> your calendar automagically.<br /> - <i>Connects</i> you with others on shared or matching goals.<br /> - <i>Encourages and alerts</i>                you when promises are at risk.<br /> Ultimately, ZinZen helps you create the future you want, while allowing you to relax and fully enjoy every moment of the present.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Who owns ZinZen?</b><br /> ZinZen will be steward-owned. This means:<br />
                <b>1.</b> All decisions are made by the stewards - and the stewards only.<br />
                <b>2.</b> All decisions must be in the best interests of the company's purpose.<br />
                <b>Consequences:</b><br /> - ZinZen's decision power can never be sold or inherited.<br /> - All net profits go to making ZinZen better.<br />
                <b>NB:</b> Each investment round is capped.<br />Once a predetermined (decent) % is reached - the round ends.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Who develops ZinZen?</b><br /> At the moment I'm a single non-pro developer challenging established companies that have tens to thousands of employees.
                <br /> Please help ZinZen by giving suggestions, skills and/or money!<br /> The goals I've defined so far can be found on
                <a href="https://zinzen.me/?profile=tijl.leenders&listId=fcbd9d74-2a52-9336-316c-e044a1c000c2">my public ZinZen agenda</a>.<br />

                receive any!<br />
                <br />

                <br />

                <b>ZinZen&reg; TERMS OF SERVICE</b><br /> Last Modified: August 11th 2021<br />
                <br /> Effective: August 11th 2021<br />
                <br />
                <b>Welcome to ZinZen!</b><br /> Thank you for your interest.<br /> If you are looking for our Privacy Policy, you can find it at https://ZinZen.me/?page=privacy<br />
                <br /> The ZinZen Service is offered by ZinZen ("ZinZen"), a company established under Dutch law, registered at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce under no. 834 673 94, with its registered office in the city of Numansdorp at Nassaustraat 67,
                postal code 3281BR, The Netherlands.<br />
                <br /> These Terms of Service apply at all times during the use of the ZinZen Service.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Definitions:</b><br /> At the end of this document you will find the definitions of the words in this agreement that begin with a capital letter.<br /> If you are viewing this document through a browser, you might also be able to see
                a pop-over with the definition while hovering over the word with your mouse.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Our Agreement:</b><br /> By using the ZinZen Service, you agree to the terms and conditions listed on this page (the "Terms of Service").
                <br /> Your acceptance is required to conclude an Agreement with us to become a User of the ZinZen Service.<br /> In addition, merely using the ZinZen Service shall also constitute your consent to these Terms of Service and our Privacy
                Policy.
                <br /> Therefore, these Terms of Service at all times govern the use of the ZinZen Service and form an integral part of the Agreement between ZinZen and each User.<br /> We advise you to save a copy of these Terms of Service locally or
                print them.<br /> Any terms and conditions or exceptions put forward by you will not form part of the Agreement, unless we have explicitly accepted them in writing.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Signing up for your ZinZen Account:</b><br /> During the sign-up process you will be asked to register an Username, e.g. userAbc123 or user@example.com, and a password for your Account.<br /> If the Username you have chosen is not available,
                you must choose another Username which is available.<br /> The Username which you provide for your Account does not necessarily have to be your real name, but you explicitly accept all responsibility and full liability for any damages,
                claims or other consequences that may arise as a result of signing up under a fictitious or pseudonymous name.<br /> If you register a Username that is a valid email address, we will use this email as the Recovery E-mail Address.
                <br /> Your password must meet the safety requirements as indicated in the sign-up process.<br /> In order to complete the sign-up process you must complete both mandatory fields on the form : the Username field and the password field.<br
                /> Once your order has been successfully submitted, you can log into your Account with the chosen Username and password.
                <br /> After signing up, you may change your password, Recovery E-mail Address or any other email addresses associated to your Account at any time by using the available option in your Settings.<br /> You can only access the Settings feature
                while you are logged into your Account.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Confirmation and communication about your ZinZen Account:</b><br /> Once you have successfully signed up, you have become an authorized User of the ZinZen Service, pursuant to the Agreement concluded between you, the User, and us, ZinZen.<br
                /> In some cases we'll send an automatic welcome message to the inbox of your new ZinZen Account (and to the Recovery E-mail Address if it was provided)<br /> Your Settings will contain an internet link to the current version of this Agreement.<br
                /> Whenever we have an important message for you concerning your Account, for example a reminder about payment in order to avoid the expiration of your Account, we will send a message to your ZinZen inbox. <br /> We may also suggest you
                to set a Recovery E-mail Address or provide you a recovery code to be able to help you recover your Account if you ever lose your password.<br /> We may also provide additional information services, but only after you have opted-in for
                them. You may opt out whenever you like by clicking the unsubscribe hyperlink in the message, or by changing your Settings.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Duration:</b><br /> Unless otherwise stated in the Agreement, the Agreement is valid for an indefinite period.<br /> For the terms and conditions for termination, please review the relevant sections below.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Cooling off period:</b><br /> Within the sign-up process, by agreeing to these Terms of Service you also agree to receive the ZinZen Service right after signing up, and therefore no cooling off period shall apply.<br /> The cooling
                off period is a legal right for consumers in Europe, to cancel an agreement concluded online, if certain criteria are met. If the consumer agrees to receive the service immediately, no cooling off period will apply.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Authorized access:</b><br /> The ZinZen Service may only be used by authorized Users who provide Login Details.<br /> You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Login Details, and that
                it is your responsibility to remember them.<br /> ZinZen uses secure hashing methods in accordance with industry best practices, in order to store key material safely. In order to keep up with technological developments, ZinZen may decide
                at any moment to update its security practices.<br /> ZinZen may assume that someone logging onto the ZinZen Service using the Login Details actually is the User. After access has been obtained to the ZinZen Service through the User's
                Login Details, the User bears the full responsibility and risk for all subsequent activities undertaken in the ZinZen Service (including the Account).
                <br /> In the event of any known or suspected misuse or compromise of the Login Details, the User must notify ZinZen immediately at abuse@ZinZen.me so that the latter can take action.<br /> If ZinZen becomes aware that the User's Login
                Details have been divulged to unauthorized third parties, ZinZen will try to notify the User and take suitable action.<br /> If you have provided us with a Recovery E-mail Address or opted to receive a Recovery Code, you have the ability
                to set a new password in the event you have lost your current password and are unable to log into the ZinZen Service.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>WARNING:</b><br /> IF YOU FORGET YOUR PASSWORD AND HAVE NOT SUPPLIED US WITH A RECOVERY E-MAIL ADDRESS AND HAVE NOT OPTED TO RECEIVE A RECOVERY CODE, THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN ENABLE YOU TO REGAIN ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT.<br /> THIS IS
                AN INTENTIONAL SECURITY FEATURE AND NOT A BUG.<br /> ZinZen CANNOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF YOUR LOSS OF OR FAILURE TO REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORD.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Terms of use:</b><br /> We have designed the ZinZen Service around the principle that your goals and plans are your business and nobody else's, including ours.<br /> The privacy that we provide to you through the ZinZen Service does
                not place you above the law, and it must not be abused.<br /> You are prohibited from using the ZinZen Service to break the law or violate anyone's legal rights.<br /> You are prohibited from sending automated queries. Please contact permissions@ZinZen.me
                for more information regarding automated queries.<br /> Activities that are absolutely not tolerated by ZinZen include the sending of Spam, the purchase or sale of stolen goods, making threats to person or property, possession or distribution
                of child pornography, and fraud.
                <br /> ZinZen may immediately terminate the Agreement and delete the Account if we learn that you have provided us with false or misleading registration information, interfered with other Users or the administration of ZinZen's services,
                or violated these Terms of Service, and retain any evidence or information relevant to this decision.
                <br /> In the event of such termination, ZinZen will notify the User by means of the Recovery E-mail Address, if one was previously set.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Measures against Spam and excessive use:</b><br /> Sending Spam through the ZinZen Service is prohibited.<br /> In order to block Spam and to mitigate the risk that ZinZen could be blacklisted by e-mail providers or their spam filters,
                which may cause severe adverse effects for all Users of the ZinZen Service, we limit the number of messages that can be sent during a given time period.<br /> In order to offer the ZinZen Service without incurring a financial loss, we
                limit the use of the ZinZen Service per User for any type of Agreement during a given time period.<br /> Consequently, if you send too many messages in a short time or use the service excessively, your outgoing messages may be blocked
                and your use restricted, even your messages are not unsolicited and do not strictly qualify as Spam, as defined in the definitions section below. When your messages are blocked for this reason or your usage of the ZinZen Service is restricted,
                you will be informed via a warning message.<br /> If we find that you are using the ZinZen Service excessively or sending excessive amounts of messages often or regularly, or in any other way compromising the ability of other Users to
                enjoy the ZinZen Service fully, we may suspend or terminate your Account, after we have issued at least one warning to you.<br /> In order to safeguard the effectiveness of our measures against Spam and excessive use, we cannot provide
                full details of the measures we employ, nor the exact limitations caused by these measures.<br /> Our measures against Spam and excessive outgoing messages should not affect normal, average use of the ZinZen Service. <br /> If you experience
                that your legitimate (and not excessive) use is restricted or your messages are not being sent or received properly, or that our anti-Spam measures may otherwise impair your legitimate use of the ZinZen Service, please inform us as soon
                as possible through restrictions@ZinZen.me. Please include as much technical information as possible indicating that the problems are due to our systems and are not caused by other links in the Internet communication chain which are beyond
                our control.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Compliance with legitimate requests by authorities:</b><br /> While we respect and try to protect your privacy to the best of our abilities, your use of ZinZen does not place you above the law.<br /> But neither do we place authorities
                above the law. If we receive a request by Dutch judicial authorities to hand over information about one of our Users, we will have our lawyers check the validity of the request and determine whether we are obliged to comply. <br /> We
                will NOT comply with such requests unless we are convinced that the request is legally valid and we believe it is undeniably our legal obligation to comply.<br /> We will NOT comply with requests from any authorities other than Dutch authorities.
                If we receive a request from any foreign government, we will refuse to comply and will instead refer the requestor to place a formal request to the Dutch authorities for mutual assistance.<br /> ZinZen will never cooperate with any voluntary
                surveillance programs. Under the strong current laws that protect the right to privacy in Europe, European governments cannot legally force service providers like ZinZen to implement a blanket spying program on their users. Should that
                ever change, we will use all methods at our disposal to resist.<br />

                content created by Users.<br /> Unless otherwise agreed by means of a separate agreement, "use" by ZinZen shall be interpreted in its broadest sense, including but not limited to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell.<br />                The Agreement grants the User a personal, worldwide, non-assignable and non-exclusive right to use the ZinZen Service.

                <br />
                <b>Termination by the User:</b><br /> Any User can terminate the Agreement by clicking a button or link within the ZinZen Service containing "Terminate Account" or words of a similar nature and meaning.<br /> A User may terminate the Agreement
                in this way at any time and without stating any reasons or grounds for doing so.
                <br /> Terminating the Agreement does not constitute or create the right to ask for repayment or refund of (all or part of) the subscription fee for the period during which the Agreement would otherwise have remained valid.<br /> When
                an Agreement is terminated by a User, all data contained in the Account, including all personal data, is immediately deleted permanently. Only the backup will remain for the maximum retention period of thirty-five (35) days, as described
                in the Backup section above. The User has no right to obtain or gain access to (personal) data stored in this temporary backup after termination.<br /> Any anonymized or pseudonimized data does not have to be deleted - but may be.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Expiration and renewal:</b><br /> When the payment term of your Account expires, a quarantine period of six (6) months starts. The first thirty (30) days of this period will be considered a grace period and certain restrictions may
                apply.
                <br /> After this grace period of thirty (30) days, the User can no longer make use of the product and the Account will be put in quarantine state. If the User pays the applicable fee after the grace period but within six (6) months after
                expiration, the Account will be reinstated, and a new payment term will start from the moment of payment.
                <br /> Before expiration of the Account, ZinZen will provide multiple messages through the ZinZen inbox (and the Recovery E-mail Address, if provided by the User), in order to remind the User of the upcoming expiration of the Account,
                and of the option of providing payment to maintain the use of the Account.<br /> If the User does not pay the required fee within six (6) months after the start of the quarantine period, the Agreement will be deemed fully terminated and
                the Account will be deleted.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Consequences of termination:</b><br /> When an Agreement is fully terminated, all data contained in the Account, including all personal data, is immediately deleted permanently. Only the backup will remain for the maximum retention
                period of thirty-five (35) days, as described in the Backup section above. ZinZen has no obligation to restore an Account from such backups on request of the User once the Account has been terminated.<br /> Any anonymized or pseudonimized
                data does not have to be deleted - but may be.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Final provisions:</b><br /> The Agreement shall be governed by Dutch law, without regard to any conflict of law provisions contained in Dutch law.<br /> The court of the Hague, the Netherlands, shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle
                disputes relating to the Agreement which cannot be settled amicably, except if Dutch imperative law should provide otherwise.<br /> In the event that ZinZen requires urgent legal measures or relief against a User and the court chosen above
                cannot provide this, ZinZen may submit an application to any other court in any other jurisdiction.<br /> Changes in management or legal form will not affect the Agreement.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Partial nullity:</b> in the event that one or more of the provisions of this Agreement and/or the Terms of Service should be nullified, the remaining provisions of this Agreement and/or the Terms of Service shall remain in full force.
                In this case, the Parties shall agree on (a) new provision(s) to replace the nullified provisions, having regard to the purpose and purport of the original Agreement and/or Terms of Service as far as possible.
                <br />
                <br /> If ZinZen does not exercise or enforce a legal right or remedy which is available to ZinZen under the Agreement and applicable law, this will not constitute a formal waiver and ZinZen will still be entitled to such rights or remedies.
