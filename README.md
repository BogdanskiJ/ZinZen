## ZinZen®: a platform for planning your purpose(s).

[ZinZen®](https://ZinZen.me) is a platform for stress-free life planning.  
ZinZen® gives you the peace of mind to live in the now by making sure that:

- your life is on track with your priorities/goals
- your planning calendar is realistic
- you won't forget anything important

It is also a way to collaborate efficiently with others to achieve shared goals.

- The first phase is a **smart** todo-app for a single individual.
- The second phase will be collaborative.

A lot of things in life can be managed by making lists (of lists...) with constraints and dependencies between them.

See ... for some ideas.
