## Documentation

Here you'll find the the ZinZen&reg; frontend:

- [functional docs](functional/Readme.md)
- [technical architecture](technical/Readme.md), which includes the dev setup.

The scheduling algorithm details are separated from the frontend in a [different ZinZen-scheduler repository](https://github.com/tijlleenders/ZinZen-scheduler).
