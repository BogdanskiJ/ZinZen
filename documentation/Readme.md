## Documentation

This folder attempts to keep a living permanent documentation of both the [functional](functional/Readme.md) aspects
of the ZinZen&reg; frontend, and the [technical architecture](technical/Readme.md) of the code-base.

All the details about the scheduling algorithm are separated from the frontend in a [different ZinZen-scheduler repository](https://github.com/tijlleenders/ZinZen-scheduler). 

If you'd rather dive in to the code head-first a good place to start is the [Development Setup](technical/Development-Setup.md)
page.
