# Use react framework

# Accepted

# Context

We need to get contributions from the community to stay in touch with needs - and lower costs.  
To do this, we need to lower the barriers to entry for newcomers. They need to be able to jump in, solve an issue, and move on.

# Decision

Use a popular framework like React.

# Consequences

- Rewrite the vanilla JS to React.
- Keep up to date with versions of the framework.

# Alternatives considered

- Vanilla JS : this is too high a barrier for newcomers to quickly understand the code and reason about.
- Other frameworks : More complex and/or less popular.
