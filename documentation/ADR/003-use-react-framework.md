# Use react framework

# Accepted

# Context

We need to get contributions from the community to stay in touch with needs - and lower costs.  
To do this, we need to lower the barriers to entry for newcomers. They need to be able to jump in, solve an issue, and move on.
We've already decided on a reactive UI model in the vanilla JS implementation - but without motivating it clearly.

# Decision

Use a popular framework like React.

# Rationale

- React is the most popular framework out there for reactive UI's - with the most readily available talent.
- It's open source.
- It has a lot of commercial users - so continuity is less of a risk

# Consequences

- Rewrite the vanilla JS to React.
- Keep up to date with versions of the framework.

# Alternatives considered

- Vanilla JS : this is too high a barrier for newcomers to quickly understand the code and reason about.
- Other frameworks : More complex and/or less popular.
